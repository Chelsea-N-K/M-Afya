    <h2>Adult Choking </h2>

    <p>Choking is when your airway gets blocked and you can’t breathe properly. <br>When someone chokes, the airway can either be partly or fully blocked. <br> If it’s a mild blockage, they should be able to clear it themselves by coughing. <br> If it’s a severe blockage, they won’t be able to cough so without anyone’s help they’ll become unresponsive.</p>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li> Encourage them to cough. If this doesn't clear the obstruction, support their upper body with one hand and help them lean forward.</li>
        <li>If coughing doesn’t work, help the casualty bend forward.</li>
        <li>Use the heel of your hand to give up to five sharp back blows between their shoulder blades.</li>
        <li>Check their mouth to see if there’s anything in there and, if there is, get them to pick it out.</li>
        <br>

        <li>If back blows don’t work, give up to five abdominal thrusts. Stand behind them.</li>
        <li>Link your hands between their tummy button and the bottom of their chest, with your lower hand clenched in a fist.</li>
        <li>Pull sharply inwards and upwards.</li>

        <li>If they’re still choking, call 999 or 112 for medical help.</li>
        <li>Once you’ve called, continue steps 2 and 3 – back blows and abdominal thrusts – until what’s in there has cleared, help arrives or they become unresponsive.</li>
        <li>If they become unresponsive at any stage, open their airway and check their breathing.</li>
        <li>If they’re not breathing, start chest compressions and rescue breaths (CPR - cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to try to release whatever’s stuck in there. Follow the instructions for treating someone who’s unresponsive and not breathing.</li>
    </ol>
