    <h2>Bleeding</h2>

    <p>In this section you can find out what to do about bleeding and blood loss.<br>
        You can learn how to give first aid treatment for cuts, grazes, and nose bleeds as well as finding out what to do if someone is bleeding severely.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Cuts and grazes</h3>
    <p>Cuts and grazes are common injuries that can usually be treated at home.</p>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
    <li>Clean the wound by rinsing it under running water or using alcohol-free wipes.</li>
    <li>Pat it dry using a gauze swab and cover it with sterile gauze. If you don’t have these, then use a clean, non-fluffy cloth.</li>
    <li>Raise and support the part of the body that’s injured. If it’s a hand or arm, raise it above the head. If it’s a lower limb, lay them down and raise the cut area above the level of the heart. This will help stop the bleeding.</li>
    <li>Remove the gauze covering the wound and apply a sterile dressing.</li>
    <li>If you think there’s any risk of infection then suggest they see a health care professional.</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Nose bleeds</h3>
    <p>A nose bleed is when blood flows from one or both nostrils. It’s normally caused by the tiny blood vessels inside the nostrils being ruptured.
        Common causes of nose bleeds include a blow to the nose, sneezing, picking or blowing the nose, and high blood pressure.</p>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>If someone is having a nose bleed, your priority is to control the bleeding and keep their airway open.</li>
        <li>Get them to sit down (not lie down) as keeping the nose above the heart will reduce bleeding.</li>
        <li>Get them to lean forward (not backwards), to make sure the blood drains out through their nose, rather than down their throat which could block their airway.</li>
        <li>Ask them to breathe through their mouth and pinch the soft part of the nose, taking a brief pause every ten minutes, until the bleeding stops.</li>
        <li>Encourage them not to speak, swallow, cough, spit or sniff because this may break blood clots that may have started to form in the nose.</li>
        <li>If the bleeding is severe, or if it lasts more than 30 minutes, call 999 or 112 for medical help.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Severe Bleeding</h3>
    <p>When bleeding is severe, it can be dramatic and distressing. <br>If someone’s bleeding isn’t controlled quickly, they may lose a lot of blood, become unresponsive or develop shock.<br> Shock does not mean emotional shock; it is a life-threatening condition, often caused by loss of blood.With all open wounds, there’s a risk of infection, so wash your hands and use gloves (if you have any) to help prevent any infection passing between you both.</p>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <b>If there's an object in the wound</b>
       <p>If there’s an object in there, don’t pull it out, because it may be acting as a plug to reduce the bleeding.
       <br>
       Instead, leave it in and apply pressure either side of it with a pad (such as a clean cloth) or fingers, until a sterile dressing is available.</p>

        <b>If there's no object in the wound</b>
        <p>Follow the steps below for treating severe bleeding.</p>
        <ol id="last">
        <li>Press it: apply direct pressure to the wound</li>
        <li>Call 999/112 for emergency help</li>
        <li>Firmly secure dressing with a bandage</li>
        <li>Treat for shock</li>
        <li>Support the injured part</li>
        </ol>
