    <p>If someone is not moving and does not respond when you call them or gently shake their shoulders, they are unresponsive.</p>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <b>Step 1 of 5: Open their airway</b>
        <ul>
            <li>If they are unresponsive, open their airway.</li>
            <li>Place one hand on the casualty’s forehead and two fingers under their chin. Gently tilt their head back and lift the chin.</li>
        </ul>
    <br>

    <b>Step 2 of 5: Check their breathing</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain the head tilt and chin lift, and look for chest movement.</li>
            <li>Listen for the sounds of normal breathing and see if you can feel their breaths on your cheek.</li>
            <li>If they are not breathing, you need to start CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation – a combination of chest pressure and rescue breaths) straight away.</li>
        </ul>
    <br>

    <br>

    <b>Step 3 of 5: Call for help and start CPR</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Call 999 or 112 for an ambulance, or get someone else to do it.</li>
            <li>Next you’ll need to perform CPR - cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This involves giving someone chest compressions and rescue breaths to keep their heart and circulation going.</li>
            <li>If they start breathing normally again, stop CPR and put them in the recovery position.</li>
        </ul>
    <br>

    <b>Step 4 of 5: Giving chest compressions</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Kneel down beside the casualty on the floor level with their chest.</li>
            <li>Place the heel of one hand towards the end of their breastbone, in the centre of their chest.</li>
            <li>Place the heel of your other hand on top of the first hand and interlock your fingers, making sure you keep the fingers off the ribs.</li>
            <li>Lean over the casualty, with your arms straight, pressing down vertically on the breastbone, and press the chest down by 5-6cm (2-2½in).</li>
            <li>Release the pressure without removing your hands from their chest. Allow the chest to come back up fully – this is one compression.</li>
            <li>Repeat 30 times, at a rate of about twice a second or the speed of the song ‘Staying Alive’.</li>
            <li>Give two rescue breaths.</li>
        </ul>

    <b>Step 5 of 5: How to give a rescue breath</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the casualty’s airway is open.</li>
            <li>Pinch their nose firmly closed.</li>
            <li>Take a deep breath and seal your lips around their mouth.</li>
            <li>Blow into the mouth until the chest rises.</li>
            <li>Remove your mouth and allow the chest to fall.</li>
            <li>Repeat once more.</li>
            <li>Carry on giving 30 chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths for as long as you can, or until help arrives.</li>
            <li>If the casualty starts breathing normally again, stop CPR and put them in the recovery position.</li>
        </ul>
