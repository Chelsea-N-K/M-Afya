    <h3>Choking advice for parents</h3>

    <p>Young children are more likely to choke than adults, because they often put small objects in their mouths that they may breathe in and get stuck.
        <br>
        If a child or baby is choking they’ll get upset quickly and you need to act fast to clear what’s stuck.
        <br>
        If they can’t cough or make any noise, it’s serious.</p>

    <h4>Choking child</h4>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <b><u>1. Cough it out</u></b>
    <ul>
        <li>Encourage them to cough it out. If that doesn't work, try to slap it out.</li>
    </ul>

    <b><u>2. Slap it out</u></b>
    <br>
        If coughing doesn't work:
        <ul>
            <li>Help the child bend forward and use the heel of your hand to give up to five sharp back blows between their shoulder blades.</li>
            <li>Check their mouth to see if there’s anything in there. If there is, get them to pick it out themselves.</li>
        </ul>

    <b>3. Squeeze it out</b>
    <br>
        If the back blows don't work, try giving them up to five abdominal thrusts:
        <ul>
            <li>To do this, stand behind the child, making sure they are bending well forward.</li>
            <li>Link your hands between their tummy button and the bottom of their chest, with your lower hand clenched in a fist.</li>
            <li>Then pull sharply inwards and upwards.</li>
        </ul>

        If they're still choking call 999 or 112 for an ambulance.
        <ul>
            <li>Once you’ve called an ambulance, continue steps 2 ‘ Slap it out’ and 3 ‘Squeeze it out’ until what’s in there has cleared, help arrives or they become unresponsive.</li>
            <li>If they become unresponsive at any stage, open their airway and check their breathing. If they’re not breathing, start CPR - cardiopulmonary resuscitation to try to release whatever’s stuck in there. Follow the instructions for someone who's unresponsive and not breathing.</li>
        </ul>
