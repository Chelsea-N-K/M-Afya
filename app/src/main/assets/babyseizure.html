    <h3>Seizures (fits) in children</h3>

    <p>During a seizure, lots of muscles in the body contract uncontrollably.
        <br>
        It’s also called a convulsion or fit.
        <br>
        Seizures are caused by something interrupting the electrical activity in the brain and they usually make someone lose responsiveness.
        <br>
        In children, seizures normally happen as a result of a high temperature, or because of an infection such as a throat or ear infection.
        <br>
        This is because the electrical systems in their brain are not developed enough to deal with the body’s high temperature.</p>

    <h5>Steps</h5>

    <ol>
        <li>Don’t restrain or move them. Instead, protect them from hurting themselves. Clear away any potentially dangerous objects, like hot drinks or sharp objects, and put pillows or soft padding around them.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Cool them down. Take away any bedding and take off a layer of clothing.</li>
        <li>Make sure they get some fresh air by opening a door or window, but be careful you don’t cool them down too much.</li>
        <li>Once the seizure has stopped, they’re usually very sleepy or unresponsive, so put them into the recovery position to help them keep their airway open.</li>
        <li>Then call 999 or 112 for emergency medical help.</li>
        <li>Reassure them – and whoever’s looking after them, if that is not you.</li>
        <li>While you wait for help to arrive, keep checking their breathing, pulse and level of response.</li>
    </ol>
